### Warning - This is a proof of concept project, is not can be usage yet! üë®‚Äçüíª 
----

The project goal is allow full projects run in own network nodes as P2P application on easy mode, (like framework) to make your fully decentralized modern application as peer to peer (without center server needed)

My main tech motivation is improving myself üß† about decentralization concepts and limitations, and can to use my other knowledges, like networks, linux and development skills.

I want any developer can be insert this tools on your application (`nodeJS` api + frontend) and done (with exception data for now)! Your application can be decentralized.

Has some limitations about this goal, I understand. But I'm solving this with alternatives and doing documentation for improving each part. Is probably that on the future, our limitations on the network there are smaller, I'll learn more and who know any genius guy can be help us.

For see a complete sample about how to it`s work on express application, can you see: [Backend-demo - fdApps](https://github.com/fdapps-tools/backend-demo)

This application is rewriting in Rust Language with neon help, [see neon default readme](docs/neon.md).

Actually this contains code salad with JS source in src/js and init rust code in src/lib.rs and I'm rewriting from JS to Rust.

# Package features

* [Tunneling](docs/Tunneling.md) to delivery application P2P;
* [Storage](docs/Storage.md) Node Informations;
* Communication between nodes;
* [Consensous algorithm](docs/NodeManager.md);

## Premises

  - Application fully run on *P2P enviroment* - Offile just if last Node to down;
  - It must be possible that any *modern frontend* (VueJS, React, Angular, etc) can be delivery;
  - The components are modularized, as tools for easy maintable and not language blocked;
  - Need *automatized tests* for all;
  - Remove all that's possible about centralized resources;


# TODO

* Rewrite modules - src/js to Rust;
* Improve tests coverage;
* Improve consensous;
* Improve tunneling;
* Tests

# How to contribute
If you fell here out of nowhere but liked something you've read, I'm counting on your help for the project to grow, after all, despite starting from me, it's not for me, but for everyone.

There are many ways to contribute, because everything we have is here and there is little, documentation, design, tests, ideas, dissemination... Everything is important.

Even your questioning about how it works will help me to be even more clear on my goals, as well as your extra ideas on how to make the project better, so feel free to contribute as you like.
